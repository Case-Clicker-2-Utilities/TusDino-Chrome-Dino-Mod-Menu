> **I stopped development for this project and won't be working on it for a while. I'll probably be working on it again sometime!**

> The reasons why I stopped working was because people stole my entire code and claimed it as their own, lack of motivation and I ran out of ideas. But, I still plan on releasing the unobfuscated source code and publishing it on Greasyfork.

> ***Of course, this project will still stay up for people to use!***

# TusDino 0.15.1
TusDino is the most advanced userscript chrome dino cheat with over 40+ cheats and that works on almost any dino game website. It was created as a fun project. I'll probably work on it whenever I feel like it. **You need a userscript manager in order to install the script. I recommend Tampermonkey!** 

[![Install from Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20Script-Github-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Fault-Utilities/TusDino-Chrome-Dino-Mod-Menu/raw/main/tusdino.user.js)

**You need to install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or any userscript manager or the script wont work**

If you're not on chrome, then you can check out [other userscript managers for your browser](https://github.com/Fault-Utilities/TusDino-Chrome-Dino-Mod-Menu#userscript-managers)

## Installation Insructions
- Get [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), or any UserScript manager, but TamperMonkey is recommended. If you're not on chrome, then you can search for other userscript managers for your browser.
- Download the script from [Github](https://github.com/Fault-Utilities/TusDino-Chrome-Dino-Mod-Menu/raw/main/tusdino.user.js).
- If you see the script on TamperMonkey, it means you did it correctly. Congrats!
- Go to the [game](https://chromedino.com/)
- *If you don't see the script then try to redo the Installation process*

**It would be great if you left a star! It would help with motivation.**
